# Starbucks

1. Problem Definition:

We aimed to predict wait time for drinks served by Starbucks, using a dataset with employee and drink information. Our goal was to create a predictive model that could help minimize wait times by understanding which factors contribute to longer delays.

2. Data Preprocessing:

•	We started with data cleaning and preprocessing:

•	Missing Values: We handled the missing value in wait_time by removing the row with the missing value.

•	Categorical Encoding: We used Label Encoding to convert categorical variables like shift, drink_name, employee_id, and starbucks_id into numeric formats that could be used by the machine learning model.

•	Feature Engineering: We created new features such as interactions between different features (e.g., shift_drink_interaction) and incorporated meaningful data points into the model.

3. Model Building:

•	We used a Random Forest Regressor model, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict wait_time.

•	Initially, we trained the model without hyperparameter tuning and evaluated its performance, resulting in:
	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 6.98 (indicating the average error of around 7 minutes).
	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 68.5 (larger errors were being penalized more heavily).

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:

•	To improve the model's performance, we performed GridSearchCV, which helps in finding the best set of hyperparameters for the model.

•	After tuning, the best parameters were found to be:
	max_depth: 10
	min_samples_leaf: 2
	min_samples_split: 10
	n_estimators: 100

•	After tuning, the model’s performance improved:
	MAE dropped to 6.48.
	MSE dropped to 56.02, indicating the model became more accurate in predicting wait times.

5. Cross-Validation Results:

•	We performed 5-fold cross-validation, which showed:

•	Average MAE: 6.48, with a very low standard deviation (0.05), indicating that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

6. Model Performance and Evaluation:

•	The model now consistently predicts wait times with an average error of 6.48 minutes.

•	The low standard deviation in cross-validation suggests that the model is stable and generalizes well to different data subsets.

•	The lower MSE indicates the model is better at minimizing large errors compared to the initial model.

7. Feature Importance:

•	By analyzing feature importances, we can see which factors (e.g., drink_name, employee_id, shift, average_making_time (min)) have the most significant influence on predicting wait times.

•	Important Features: Features like drink_name and employee_id played a key role in the model’s ability to predict wait_time.

8. Conclusion:

•	The model has achieved reasonable performance with an MAE of 6.48 minutes, meaning it can predict wait times for Starbucks orders with an average error of around 6.5 minutes.

•	The model is stable, performs well across different subsets of the data, and has been improved through hyperparameter tuning.

•	This model can be used to predict wait times based on features like shift, employee, drink type, and average making time, which could help optimize staffing and improve customer experience.

In Summary:

•	The model provides a useful prediction of wait times, with acceptable accuracy for operational decisions (error of around 6 minutes).

•	The insights gained (e.g., important features like drink_name and employee_id) could help improve operational efficiency and predict when to expect longer or shorter wait times.

•	With further refinement, the model could be integrated into real-time decision-making systems to optimize staffing and enhance customer service.
